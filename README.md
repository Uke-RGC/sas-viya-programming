## Overview
A collection of repositories contain code samples and other materials to help you learn to access SAS Viya services by writing programs in Python, SAS, and other languages.

* `/chicago` repository contains files files with data and SAS programs that are used with the *Getting Started with SAS Viya Data Mining and Machine Learning* documentation that is available from SAS.
* `/communities` contains examples of the SAS Viya Python client written about on [SAS Communities](https://communities.sas.com/).
* `/data` contains data sets for examples.
* `/deeplearning` contains a collection of deep learning projects and accompanying files.
* `/developerTrial` contains files used to seed the experience for the SAS Viya(TM) Developer Trial. 
* `/high-frequency-analytics` contains files to show Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) to identify Turbofan Engine Asset Degradation.
* `/python` contains a collection of files for Python and Viya programming.
* `/r/data-mining` contains files for Data Mining in R. 
* `/recommend`contains programs for creating a recommender system with the recommend action set. The action set is part of the *SAS Viya 3.3* release and you must have access to a version 3.3 instance of SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS).
